### -<u>quick and easy</u>




### -<u>mid-level but quickly do-able</u>


### -<u>heavy lifting, might require major changes to the code</u>

* Quickshop functionality is not working</br>


## <u>Done</u>

### -<u>quick and easy</u>

> * Products should be aligned to the left in a row</br>
> * Price should always have two digits after dot</br>
> * Currency switcher animation is too slow</br>
> * Qty badge should not show 9+ qty should always be concrete qty</br>
> * Please use variable destructuring</br>
